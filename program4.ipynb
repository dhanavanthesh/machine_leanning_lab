    "This notebook implements the Find-S algorithm to find the most specific hypothesis that is consistent with the positive training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize the hypothesis to None\n",
    "2. For each positive training example:\n",
    "   - If hypothesis is None, set it to this first positive example\n",
    "   - Otherwise, for each attribute in the example:\n",
    "     - If the attribute value is not consistent with the hypothesis, replace it with a more general constraint\n",
    "3. Return the hypothesis"

    "## How Find-S Works (Simple Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Find-S as learning what features matter for a positive outcome by examining only the positive examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with first positive example**: Begin with the first positive example as your initial hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Look at positive examples only**: Only examine data where the outcome was 'Yes'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Keep what's consistent, generalize what's not**:\n",
    "   - If you see the same value for an attribute in all positive examples (e.g., always 'Sunny'), keep it as a requirement\n",
    "   - If you see different values for an attribute (e.g., sometimes 'Hot', sometimes 'Cold'), change it to '?' meaning \"this attribute doesn't matter\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The final hypothesis tells you**: \"These specific conditions MUST be present for a positive outcome, and everything marked with '?' can vary\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your final hypothesis is ['?', '?', 'Normal', '?'], it means:\n",
    "- Weather can be anything (doesn't matter)\n",
    "- Temperature can be anything (doesn't matter)\n",
    "- Humidity MUST be Normal\n",
    "- Wind can be anything (doesn't matter)"
